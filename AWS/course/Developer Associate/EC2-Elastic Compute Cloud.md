* EC2 Instance = Virtual Machine  
* EC2 Instance Launch Type based on Billing  
* EC2 Instance Type   
    * General purpose instance type  
    * Compute optimized  
    * Memory optimized  
    * Accelerated computing  
    * Storage optimized  
* EC2 Instance Name – t3.xlarge, t2.nano, t2.small,   
* VCPU  
* RAM  
* GPU ( Graphical Processing Unit )   
* Region  
* OS --- Windows , Linux, RedHat , Ubuntu  
* Memory – 16GB ,   
* Storage – EBS  
* Billing rate per hour   
* Network performance = 50 Gigabit  
* AMI = Amazon Machine Image = It used to create EC2 instance  
* EC2 User Data  
* Custom AMI  
* AMI can be built for specific Region  
* EC2 instance storage = EBS   
* EBS = Elastic Block Storage  
* VPC = Virtual Private Cloud  
* T2 & T3 instance types are burstable instances. Burst means that this EC2 instance has OK CPU Performance.   
* Burst credits / CPU credits for burstable instances ( T2 & T3 )   
* Spike = Unexpected traffic in load  
* Availability Zones  
* Key Pairs  
* Security Group  
* Elastic IP Address  
* EC2 User data is being used to customize the EC2 instance at boot time  
* We will create the custom AMI to enhance the OS  
* EC2 instance can be launched in VPC
